15,4.0,This is the best brown pencil.,This brow pencil is amazing.  I’m on my second one.  It last all day .  I use it to shade in after lining my brow with different product.  The darker shade of brown is more of a regular brown.  I wish there was a slightly darker shade.,Complete Brow Kit

17,5.0,Great! Saves me from having to spend money on henna tint!,"I tried the henna tint a few times and it doesn't last for me.  I guess it's because I don't have eyebrow hair all the way and the tint doesn't stick to skin more than a couple of days.

21,5.0,Works great! Will buy again!,"I have tried other waterproof, all-day eyebrow pens before and some were good at first but dried up after 3 or 4 uses. I purposely waited 3 months before reviewing this product and they are still working great. They are definitely smudge-proof and water-proof but come off easily in the shower with soap and water. I wasn't sure which color to get so I bought both the dark grey color and the brown since my eyebrows are black but I have blonde hair. I'm glad I got both - I use the black/grey one to draw small individual ""hairs"" and then I use the brown to fill it in for a more natural look. I will definitely be purchasing again -",Complete Brow Kit

25,5.0,Great eyebrow pen!,"There are several in the market that have this type of tip to create multiple thin strokes but this one is my favorite so far. It creates realistic hair-like strokes and the chestnut color was not too dark. Really like it.  This also came with eyebrow stencils and a brow razor so that was a nice bonus. Great price, arrived quickly, will buy again.",Complete Brow Kit
26,5.0,Easier than expected,"I like this a lot. My typical brow filler of choice has been powder with a brush, but this is now a contender for first place. (Pencil is 3rd choice.) This brown pen color stayed in place all day, even through a workout and me touching them during the workout. I got the dark brown/chestnut and wish it was a little darker, but with my current hair color, this works better than black would. I made up the color difference by just applying it all the way through the brows (not just on the gaps), which looks great and even looks pretty natural.",Complete Brow Kit
27,5.0,Great Product that Does Not Disappoint 👍😍,This product is absolutely amazing! My brows are extremely thin and sparse. This pen did the trick.

323,4.0,Like how easy this is to use. Smudge free.,"I've only used this twice but so far I'm really liking it. I like the 3 eyebrow stencils they send in the package so you can pick how you want your brows to look. It's a little awkward at first trying to do both eyebrows the same but I finally got it. The color doesn't smudge or clump and I really like that. Once you get it on its not going anywhere. 'm not real crazy about the little tweezers. They work good but be very careful. I've pinched my skin a couple of times because they get so close. The little comb is not the best, not real sure how to use it other than comb your brows. It's a little rough. Overall I LOVE how the color goes on your brows.",Complete Brow Kit

325,5.0,ALL LINED UP & READY TO GO,"Finally! While a lot of women have sparse eyebrows, menopause completely took mine away.  I've spent years using waterproof eyebrow pencils, pomades and She-lac to keep them on my face for a few days.  While I've accomplished keeping my eyebrows for up to a week with minimal touch ups, they were too opaque and unnatural looking (though they did give a nice finish to my face.)  But these pens are now my saving grace. I use a stencil to put on some waterproof pomade and let it set for a few moments.  Then I take this pen in a color just slightly darker than the pomade and put in the hair marks lightly and voila, there you have it.  My eyebrows now look more dimensional and realistic.  So now I'm all lined up and ready to go anywhere (even swimming).  Thank heaven.",Complete Brow Kit

466,5.0,HOLY. MOLY. HOLY. GRAIL.,"Wow. As someone with a skinny eyebrow shape and yet thicker hairs on my eyebrows, it’s been hard for me to shop for eyebrow products my entire life. I’ve tried everything from the beloved Anastasia’s to higher end brands like Tom Ford and Charlotte Tillbury, even drugstore products and Japanese and Korean products and I think I’ve finally found my holy grail. This kept on me all day at work, even though I had to walk for a good distance in the rain to my car. It didn’t smudge or budge a bit for the entirety of my day and I’ve NEVER had a product that wasn’t eaten up by my weird eyebrows or completely disappeared. This product did it all. A little goes a long way, and the best part was it was so easy to get a natural and defined eyebrow shape that didn’t go over the top or too heavy either. I will be buying all my eyebrow products from them from now on. Best $9 I ever spent.",Complete Brow Kit

498,1.0,Not impressed.,"I'm going to be completely honest here. I bought this because of the reviews. I'm a mama of five that loves to do makeup when I have the time. I'm not bad at it either. I watched tutorials even, before I attempted. This thing was horrible. It didn't spit out any ""ink"" unless I pushed roughly, and doing so caused it to be uneven. I tried so many different techniques but nothing gave me that ""flawless, natural looking"" eyebrow like this thing says it will give you. I'm not a paid person. Simply a mama reviewing a spendy (to me) eyebrow ... thing. Also, I am very curious whether or not half of these reviews are even remotely honest because upon opening the packaging, the company tells you if you leave a good review and send proof, $15 will be credited to you amazon account.

628,1.0,Doesn't work after fist use,"Very expensive for something that only works once. The first time worked ok, after that you have to press so hard to get any product out onto the drawing points, the resulting effect is heavy and splodgy.
